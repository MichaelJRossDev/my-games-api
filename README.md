# House of Games API
## Setup for developers
This project requires two .env files in order to correctly connect to the databases used for testing and development.
You'll need to create two files in the root directory of the project:

**.env.development** containing ```PGDATABASE=nc_games```,
and **.env.test** containing ```PGDATABASE=nc_games_test```
